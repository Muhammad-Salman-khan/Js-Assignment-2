# JavaScript Assignment 2

This repo contains the second set of exercises I've been working on to really level up my JavaScript skills.

I built this specifically to move past the basics and actually understand how JS works under the hood. It covers some trickier concepts and helps me get more comfortable with writing cleaner, more efficient code. Basically, this is me documenting my journey to mastering the language in depth.

Feel free to poke around the code!
